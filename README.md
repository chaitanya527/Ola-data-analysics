# 📊 Ola Data Analytics Project

## 🔍 Project Overview

Ola Data Analytics is a data-driven project focused on extracting actionable insights from ride-booking data. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, represents a simulated set of bookings made on Ola, one of India’s leading ride-hailing platforms. This project showcases the complete data analytics workflow — from data collection and cleaning to cloud-based storage, SQL querying, and data visualization. Using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), I stored and queried the data efficiently with BigQuery, and built dashboards to present key business insights.
